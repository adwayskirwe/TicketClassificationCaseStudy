## General Information
Project background - For a financial company, customer complaints carry a lot of importance, as they are often an indicator of the shortcomings in their products and services. If these complaints are resolved efficiently in time, they can bring down customer dissatisfaction to a minimum and retain them with stronger loyalty. This also gives them an idea of how to continuously improve their services to attract more customers. 

These customer complaints are unstructured text data; so, traditionally, companies need to allocate the task of evaluating and assigning each ticket to the relevant department to multiple support employees. This becomes tedious as the company grows and has a large customer base.To build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, we can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.

With the help of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an approach under topic modelling, we detect patterns and recurring words present in each ticket. This can be then used to understand the important features for each cluster of categories. By segregating the clusters, we identify the topics of the customer complaints.
