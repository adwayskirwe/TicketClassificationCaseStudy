The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed.

In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction.

I called to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once I made XXXX direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in 10 days. As of XXXX I had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the 21 days to do so, so no bonus would be paid.   \n",

Morgan Chase restricted my account by my debit card Tuesday XX/XX/2019. On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

This situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with Me professionally. Thank you   \n",

They opened a ticket, got escalated to their tech team, but when I would call back to find out what happened, they told me that the case had been closed. This happened 3 times, and each call has taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information. \\n\\nGoing from ultimaterewards.com and chase.com have the  same result. \\n\\nI'm not able to use these points by phone either, because the operators for the Travel Center are not able to access my account/points neither. \\n\\nI've tried every browser, both XXXX and XXXX computers, and the XXXX Chase phone application. They all send me to the page that says \" We are unable to complete your request at this time '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I looked up some people that work in Ultimate Rewards on XXXX, and cold called a VP of Customer Relations. He acted like he was helpful at first, and we exchanged some emails. He eventually said I can buy a flight/hotel using Chase Sapphire and if I give him the details, he will deduct the appropriate points and credit my credit card for the purchase. \\n\\nLong story short, he wasn't able to fix anything. \\n\\nI can see that I'm still collecting points, but I haven't been able to access it. \\n\\nI travel a lot, and it's become a huge inconvenience that I'm not able to access these points which I intended to use for travel. I need to get this issue resolved ASAP.   \n",

He admitted that he figured out my pin because it happens to be the same as my phone password. \\n\\nHe also admitted that he would sneak into my room while I was sleeping and put the card back before I woke up. \\n\\nHe apologized but says he spent the money. I tried to dispute this with Chase but they claim that since my debit card PIN number was used that they cant prove it wasnt me. \\n\\nAlthough they advertise that I have 100 % Fraud Protection they refuse to give me my money back. \\n\\nATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$200.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$200.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$280.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$240.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$2500.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$980.00}   \n",

I contacted chase around noon today XX/XX/2019 and was asked the last 4 numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. Embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting I was over my limit which I pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that I was under my limit with the {$710.00} transaction. Never been declined by either chase or XXXX  XXXX before - today after multiple assurances that I was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never did   \n",

I made payments of {$160.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The minimum payment was {$140.00}. The closing date was XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached statement ). That statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) shows that I had an outstanding purchase balance of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were NO other purchases prior to the one on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nHowever, when I got the XXXX statement, it shows that I still have a purchase balance of {$210.00}. I have a promotional balance (@XXXX ) in XXXX of {$6900.00}. In XXXX, the promotional balance was {$7200.00} - a difference of {$380.00}. \\n\\nApparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by Chase ) I thought would be applied to the purchase (@ 21.49 % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. It is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. This is not the first time that Chase has skirted US Financial Law to turn a larger profit. I need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at Chase. Thank you in advance for your assistance. \\n\\nRespectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX   \n",

Therefore, I request a one month payment extension with my Auto Loan Company, Chase. For the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. I have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. However, On XX/XX/2019 my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. I explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. After a lengthy discussion and waiting, I was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \" contractual ''. This reason for denial baffled me and therefore I emailed the office of XXXX XXXX Executive Director, Communications, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A representative contacted me and stated Chase will follow-up. About week later a representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office called. The representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. The representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. After, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \" policy changes ''. I requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. I have received XXXX letters the reason for denial was not \" policy changes ''. I would like CFPB help in exploring the denial of my payment extension request especially since I have been clear reason for denial.   \n",

I have made several attempts to get chase bank to contact the bureau and remove this inquiry that was not authorized by me. They seem to not be able to get me to the right person to take care of this issue no matter how many attempts I have made nobody seems to understand what I'm talkin about. I want chase bank to have this fraudulent inquiry removed from my credit report before I take legal action. I I have never requested any kind of credit with chase bank or hold any account with them.

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

I was charged twice for this transaction. I placed a disputes case with Chase bank on XX/XX/2019 when I noticed the charge on my account. I called back on Sunday, XX/XX/2019 about the provisional credit for the charge and again on Monday, XX/XX/2019. I was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided. I used my debt card on Monday, XX/XX/2019 then tried to use it again but it would not work. I went to Chase bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I was shocked because I had not reported fraud on my account. I later found out that I was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I later contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX again and was told that they DID see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within 3 - 5  days. I contacted the chase disputes department again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 2019 and explained thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would credit my account and that I did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. The escalation manager did NOT care and told me that Chase decision on closing my account was final. I had been a customer of Chase for XXXX   years. My character has been challenged by the disputes agents and I consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\nI am NOT seeking to keep my account open with Chase BUT I also do NOT want Chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nOnce again, I do NOT want Chase to have the checking account that I had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by Chase. \\n\\nI did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.   \n",

       "8   On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I made a {$300.00} payment to an online retailer using Chase quick pay with XXXX on the Chase website. I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.   \n",

The merchant, XXXX XXXX, gave an estimated product shipment date of \" XX/XX/XXXX. '' After waiting for this item for a significant amount of time, I decided to cancel the order as it did not appear that the item would ever be completed and shipped. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a refund from the merchant, XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant stated that my order was cancelled, and the refund would return to the original method of payment in five business days. The original method of payment was a Chase credit card that I had since closed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a secure message to Chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open Chase cards. I also followed up with a phone call that same week, and the representative I spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase indicating that my \" disputed charge '' would remain on my account and \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account. '' I followed up with a phone call to Chase describing that this was a refund, not a dispute. The representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts. I explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds. They informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund I am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails I received from the merchant about the refund ( see Attachment ).  On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase with similar language about \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account '' and \" we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research '' ( see Attachment ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with the merchant, XXXX XXXX, requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds. On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded ( see Attachment ).

       "8   on xxxx xxxx i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this wa a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on xxxx explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient that xxxx my message wa reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i wa directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent wa trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask xxxx or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i wa looking for i called xxxx who automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i wa once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i wa looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there wa nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information wa not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase wa not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i wa treated by the member on their customer service team   \n",

The Chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at XXXX. I immediately went to the website and filed the claim, including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement, copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage. The website even had \" books '' as one of the catagories I could list as the type of item they cover and that I could make a claim on. After following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to \" review my information and contact me within 5 business days to outline the next steps of the process, '' as outlined in an email I received acknowledging my claim submission, I called to complain. The representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner \" for eight to ten days '' and then it would take \" two days to actually review the claim. '' I responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email XXXX sent to me, and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works. I then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one. I was then put on hold and when she returned, she said my file had \" just been updated while I was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end. '' I explained that my daughter 's course had not ended and that I was told specifically by Chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim.

I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly.

I've done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX &amp; was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG &amp; I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids &amp; many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable &amp; reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person. I would like to preserve my good credit. I could easily transfer again to a different card, but I'd have to pay another lump sum of $ again.</td>\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased three high school textbooks for my XXXX year old daughter because she transferred to a new school. All three books were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke. The Chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at XXXX. I immediately went to the website and filed the claim, including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement, copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage. The website even had \" books '' as one of the catagories I could list as the type of item they cover and that I could make a claim on. After following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to \" review my information and contact me within 5 business days to outline the next steps of the process, '' as outlined in an email I received acknowledging my claim submission, I called to complain. The representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner \" for eight to ten days '' and then it would take \" two days to actually review the claim. '' I responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email XXXX sent to me, and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works. I then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one. I was then put on hold and when she returned, she said my file had \" just been updated while I was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end. '' I explained that my daughter 's course had not ended and that I was told specifically by Chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim. '' By the time the call ended I received an email stating that my claim status had been updated and was being denied. I find this completely outrageous and borderline fraudulent.   \n",
       "21069  I am not familiar with XXXX pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers. I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly. I would not have clicked on the to link to the extent I did if I would have been better informed.   \n",

I've had Chase credit cards, \" Chase Freedom '' specifically since XXXX with no problems ever. I've done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX & was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG & I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids & many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable & reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person. I would like to preserve my good credit. I could easily transfer again to a different card, but I'd have to pay another lump sum of $ again.   \n",

I did that to close out my account roughly {$500.00} payment when I closed out the accounts, and now I get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after 10+ years stating I owe close to {$900.00} dollars. I have never had any payment schedules or notifications in the 10+ years because I paid it off. Upon calling them I am told I need to show proof I paid it off. I would like to think that if indeed I had not paid it off ( which I did ) I would have immediately received late payment notifications. I left Chase bank because of some poor customer service and charges that were way out of line with the other banking institutions.   \n",

The website even had \" books '' as one of the catagories I could list as the type of item they cover and that I could make a claim on. After following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to \" review my information and contact me within 5 business days to outline the next steps of the process, '' as outlined in an email I received acknowledging my claim submission, I called to complain. The representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner \" for eight to ten days '' and then it would take \" two days to actually review the claim. '' I responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email XXXX sent to me, and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works. I then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one. I was then put on hold and when she returned, she said my file had \" just been updated while I was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end. '' I explained that my daughter 's course had not ended and that I was told specifically by Chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim.

I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly.

I've done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX &amp; was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG &amp; I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids &amp; many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable &amp; reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person. I would like to preserve my good credit. I could easily transfer again to a different card, but I'd have to pay another lump sum of $ again.</td>\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased three high school textbooks for my XXXX year old daughter because she transferred to a new school. All three books were damaged when a water bottle in her backpack broke. The Chase representative assured me the textbooks would be covered and instructed me to file a claim at XXXX. I immediately went to the website and filed the claim, including uploading all of the requested paperwork which included a copy of my credit card statement, copies of the three receipts and photographic evidence of the damage. The website even had \" books '' as one of the catagories I could list as the type of item they cover and that I could make a claim on. After following up repeatedly on my claim since the insurance provider failed to \" review my information and contact me within 5 business days to outline the next steps of the process, '' as outlined in an email I received acknowledging my claim submission, I called to complain. The representative said claims are not looked at by an examiner \" for eight to ten days '' and then it would take \" two days to actually review the claim. '' I responded that this information was contradictory to the information provided in writing in the email XXXX sent to me, and she said that she is not an adjuster and that is how it works. I then asked to speak with an adjuster and she agreed to connect me to one. I was then put on hold and when she returned, she said my file had \" just been updated while I was on hold and that the claim was being denied because textbooks have finite lives and are undergo revision after courses end. '' I explained that my daughter 's course had not ended and that I was told specifically by Chase that my textbook purchases would be covered and was again told they were refusing my claim. '' By the time the call ended I received an email stating that my claim status had been updated and was being denied. I find this completely outrageous and borderline fraudulent.   \n",
       "21069  I am not familiar with XXXX pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers. I believed this to be safe as it was through my Chase bank app. I have been with Chase for almost 20 years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful. I am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication. The website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent. In performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through PI it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud. Furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used I believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real XXXX XXXX Chase Bank told me they wouldnt even investigate, report this to XXXX or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter. There isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet! The chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of Chase banking service and as such, imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols. Chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the XXXX tab ... .is most certainly not true. This places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of Chase in the slightest. At minimum the risk of using XXXX on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating I have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him. I also intend to urge My neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using XXXX and XXXX integrated banking apps to the public. I understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as Chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to Be disclosed more throughly. I would not have clicked on the to link to the extent I did if I would have been better informed.   \n",

I've had Chase credit cards, \" Chase Freedom '' specifically since XXXX with no problems ever. I've done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX & was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG & I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids & many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable & reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person. I would like to preserve my good credit. I could easily transfer again to a different card, but I'd have to pay another lump sum of $ again.   \n",

I did that to close out my account roughly {$500.00} payment when I closed out the accounts, and now I get this late payment that showed up on my credit report after 10+ years stating I owe close to {$900.00} dollars. I have never had any payment schedules or notifications in the 10+ years because I paid it off. Upon calling them I am told I need to show proof I paid it off. I would like to think that if indeed I had not paid it off ( which I did ) I would have immediately received late payment notifications. I left Chase bank because of some poor customer service and charges that were way out of line with the other banking institutions.   \n",

    "    <li>It is observed that Logistic Regression provides the highest accuracy on the validation dataset and the highest F1 score as well(exact values mentioned above).</li>\n",
    "    <li>Thus, we will prefer Logistic Regression model for predictions of test complaints.</li>\n",
    "    <li>We also experimented with the hyperparameter \"NUM_TOPICS\" in NMF by keeping it as 15. Hoever, after manually assigning the 5 categories of complaints within the 15 topics and then training a supervised model on it, the accuracy obtained was about 85% on training dataset and 81% on the validation dataset (on Logistic Regression model). Hence, after experimenting, it was observed that keeping N_TOPICS value to 5 was the most suitable choice. (Please note the jupyter notebook having N_TOPICS as 15 has not been uploaded in the Upgrad portal as only 1 jupter notebook is allowed for submission. However, the second notebook can be shared across as required.\n",
    "    <li>It is also observed that manual mapping of topics with customer complaint catgories becomes a tedious and a complex process as the number of topics involved increases. \n",
