The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed.

In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction.

I called to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once I made XXXX direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in 10 days. As of XXXX I had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the 21 days to do so, so no bonus would be paid.   \n",

Morgan Chase restricted my account by my debit card Tuesday XX/XX/2019. On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

This situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with Me professionally. Thank you   \n",

They opened a ticket, got escalated to their tech team, but when I would call back to find out what happened, they told me that the case had been closed. This happened 3 times, and each call has taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information. \\n\\nGoing from ultimaterewards.com and chase.com have the  same result. \\n\\nI'm not able to use these points by phone either, because the operators for the Travel Center are not able to access my account/points neither. \\n\\nI've tried every browser, both XXXX and XXXX computers, and the XXXX Chase phone application. They all send me to the page that says \" We are unable to complete your request at this time '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I looked up some people that work in Ultimate Rewards on XXXX, and cold called a VP of Customer Relations. He acted like he was helpful at first, and we exchanged some emails. He eventually said I can buy a flight/hotel using Chase Sapphire and if I give him the details, he will deduct the appropriate points and credit my credit card for the purchase. \\n\\nLong story short, he wasn't able to fix anything. \\n\\nI can see that I'm still collecting points, but I haven't been able to access it. \\n\\nI travel a lot, and it's become a huge inconvenience that I'm not able to access these points which I intended to use for travel. I need to get this issue resolved ASAP.   \n",

He admitted that he figured out my pin because it happens to be the same as my phone password. \\n\\nHe also admitted that he would sneak into my room while I was sleeping and put the card back before I woke up. \\n\\nHe apologized but says he spent the money. I tried to dispute this with Chase but they claim that since my debit card PIN number was used that they cant prove it wasnt me. \\n\\nAlthough they advertise that I have 100 % Fraud Protection they refuse to give me my money back. \\n\\nATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$200.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$200.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$280.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$240.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$2500.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$980.00}   \n",

I contacted chase around noon today XX/XX/2019 and was asked the last 4 numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. Embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting I was over my limit which I pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that I was under my limit with the {$710.00} transaction. Never been declined by either chase or XXXX  XXXX before - today after multiple assurances that I was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never did   \n",

I made payments of {$160.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The minimum payment was {$140.00}. The closing date was XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached statement ). That statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) shows that I had an outstanding purchase balance of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were NO other purchases prior to the one on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nHowever, when I got the XXXX statement, it shows that I still have a purchase balance of {$210.00}. I have a promotional balance (@XXXX ) in XXXX of {$6900.00}. In XXXX, the promotional balance was {$7200.00} - a difference of {$380.00}. \\n\\nApparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by Chase ) I thought would be applied to the purchase (@ 21.49 % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. It is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. This is not the first time that Chase has skirted US Financial Law to turn a larger profit. I need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at Chase. Thank you in advance for your assistance. \\n\\nRespectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX   \n",

Therefore, I request a one month payment extension with my Auto Loan Company, Chase. For the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. I have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. However, On XX/XX/2019 my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. I explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. After a lengthy discussion and waiting, I was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \" contractual ''. This reason for denial baffled me and therefore I emailed the office of XXXX XXXX Executive Director, Communications, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A representative contacted me and stated Chase will follow-up. About week later a representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office called. The representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. The representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. After, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \" policy changes ''. I requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. I have received XXXX letters the reason for denial was not \" policy changes ''. I would like CFPB help in exploring the denial of my payment extension request especially since I have been clear reason for denial.   \n",

I have made several attempts to get chase bank to contact the bureau and remove this inquiry that was not authorized by me. They seem to not be able to get me to the right person to take care of this issue no matter how many attempts I have made nobody seems to understand what I'm talkin about. I want chase bank to have this fraudulent inquiry removed from my credit report before I take legal action. I I have never requested any kind of credit with chase bank or hold any account with them.

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

I was charged twice for this transaction. I placed a disputes case with Chase bank on XX/XX/2019 when I noticed the charge on my account. I called back on Sunday, XX/XX/2019 about the provisional credit for the charge and again on Monday, XX/XX/2019. I was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided. I used my debt card on Monday, XX/XX/2019 then tried to use it again but it would not work. I went to Chase bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I was shocked because I had not reported fraud on my account. I later found out that I was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I later contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX again and was told that they DID see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within 3 - 5  days. I contacted the chase disputes department again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 2019 and explained thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would credit my account and that I did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. The escalation manager did NOT care and told me that Chase decision on closing my account was final. I had been a customer of Chase for XXXX   years. My character has been challenged by the disputes agents and I consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\nI am NOT seeking to keep my account open with Chase BUT I also do NOT want Chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nOnce again, I do NOT want Chase to have the checking account that I had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by Chase. \\n\\nI did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.   \n",

       "8   On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I made a {$300.00} payment to an online retailer using Chase quick pay with XXXX on the Chase website. I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.   \n",

The merchant, XXXX XXXX, gave an estimated product shipment date of \" XX/XX/XXXX. '' After waiting for this item for a significant amount of time, I decided to cancel the order as it did not appear that the item would ever be completed and shipped. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a refund from the merchant, XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant stated that my order was cancelled, and the refund would return to the original method of payment in five business days. The original method of payment was a Chase credit card that I had since closed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a secure message to Chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open Chase cards. I also followed up with a phone call that same week, and the representative I spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase indicating that my \" disputed charge '' would remain on my account and \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account. '' I followed up with a phone call to Chase describing that this was a refund, not a dispute. The representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts. I explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds. They informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund I am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails I received from the merchant about the refund ( see Attachment ).  On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase with similar language about \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account '' and \" we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research '' ( see Attachment ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with the merchant, XXXX XXXX, requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds. On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded ( see Attachment ).

       "8   on xxxx xxxx i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this wa a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on xxxx explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient that xxxx my message wa reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i wa directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent wa trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask xxxx or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i wa looking for i called xxxx who automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i wa once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i wa looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there wa nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information wa not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase wa not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i wa treated by the member on their customer service team   \n",

I have XXXX accounts at this institution and my daughter was making a purchase at a retail store where her credit card was denied. I called Chase to find out the issue of what was wrong and they advises that our account was in loss prevention and no are no longer wanting to do business with us. I asked why and they proceeded to tell me they do n't have to disclose a reason as they are able to close accounts when they want and the reason that they have is in an internal reason and they are not able to disclose to me why. I basically asked the representative at Chase so u mean it is a big secret and he said basically yes and they will send me a check of the remaining balance in the mail in 10 days or I can go to a branch and get my money. I am at a loss for words as now I have XXXX which are accounts for a XXXX XXXX and a XXXX student where we have to figure out in a blink of an eye what our next step is. We have to stop 4 direct deposits and because what we are blue collars workers that live paycheck to paycheck and are not profitable to the bank we get the axe without any for warning. My account does not have suspicious activity. All my deposits and withdrawals are all associated with a name/place whether I use my atm card or have it directly withdrawn from my account. I work and pay bills and ensure my children 's accounts are ok and transfer money to and from of needed so everything is labeled. I think freezing someone 's account without warning is not a proper way to do business especially if we are not profitable and then proceed to say they ca n't disclose the reason why. If they feel I am doing something wrong why not advise me so it can be straightened out which is why I think it boils down to the bottom line that we are not beneficial to this XXXX dollar institution. I now need to take a day from work to go to the bank to get my money and open another account with needing to stop electronic deposits and withdrawals in a rush all because we do n't fit the ideal customer they are looking for but the business account I have my name associated with as I am a signor for our XXXX XXXX is still ok to stay open with hem because of the high balance. \\n\\nThank youXXXX XXXX</td>\n",

       "7896  Good Morning, I am wanting to advise of an issue that I was just alerted of regarding Chase Bank. I have XXXX accounts at this institution and my daughter was making a purchase at a retail store where her credit card was denied. I called Chase to find out the issue of what was wrong and they advises that our account was in loss prevention and no are no longer wanting to do business with us. I asked why and they proceeded to tell me they do n't have to disclose a reason as they are able to close accounts when they want and the reason that they have is in an internal reason and they are not able to disclose to me why. I basically asked the representative at Chase so u mean it is a big secret and he said basically yes and they will send me a check of the remaining balance in the mail in 10 days or I can go to a branch and get my money. I am at a loss for words as now I have XXXX which are accounts for a XXXX XXXX and a XXXX student where we have to figure out in a blink of an eye what our next step is. We have to stop 4 direct deposits and because what we are blue collars workers that live paycheck to paycheck and are not profitable to the bank we get the axe without any for warning. My account does not have suspicious activity. All my deposits and withdrawals are all associated with a name/place whether I use my atm card or have it directly withdrawn from my account. I work and pay bills and ensure my children 's accounts are ok and transfer money to and from of needed so everything is labeled. I think freezing someone 's account without warning is not a proper way to do business especially if we are not profitable and then proceed to say they ca n't disclose the reason why. If they feel I am doing something wrong why not advise me so it can be straightened out which is why I think it boils down to the bottom line that we are not beneficial to this XXXX dollar institution. I now need to take a day from work to go to the bank to get my money and open another account with needing to stop electronic deposits and withdrawals in a rush all because we do n't fit the ideal customer they are looking for but the business account I have my name associated with as I am a signor for our XXXX XXXX is still ok to stay open with hem because of the high balance. \\n\\nThank youXXXX XXXX   \n",

At least I thought I did. Turns out it was used for an online purchase I made by mistake in XXXX. The payment should have never gone through but apparently they did n't cancel the card. Anyways I did n't get any notification of the payment because the emails were going to my junk email. I was notified by XXXX XXXX yesterday (XX/XX/XXXX ) that I had a delinquent account. I paid it immediately. I attempted in the morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to ask Chase to remove the negative remark from my account. They informed me the federal government requires them to report negative actions according to the fair credit reporting act. I found out that was n't true. A few hours later I called them back to discuss why they had lied to me. I attempted to record the phone call and they refused to talk to me because I was recording the call. I refused to stop recording and ended the call   \n",
